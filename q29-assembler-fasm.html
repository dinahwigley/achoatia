                            <p> BadgerPriest's original post ( Updated: 2012-04-06 11:56 PM EST External Resources https://github.com/dcpu16 DCPU Search @ Github (https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93ampq=dcpuamptype=Everythingamprepo=amplangOverride=ampstart_value=1) A Compendium of Utilities @ 0x10cforum.com ( Emulators I am stuck implementing my compiler at the moment. I had wanted it to output x86 assembly that I would then pass onto an assembler (currently FASM). But I've been having thoughts about using LLVM instead, but certain things keep me from doing so, such as: 1. A new calling convention. Here return values are passed directly on the stack into the previous stack frame, unless they fit in registers. 2. Bad Java bindings. This isn't just a "how to do this for my compiler" but I'm interested Right now, my compiler uses FASM as it's backend, but it doesn't seem to support "custom debug symbols", I can't even define line numbers. Now NASM supports defining line numbers, so I might switch to that, but looking at it it doesn't support setting the source code on a certain line (Sorry, I don't know the terminology of this kind of thing). Am I missing something from NASM amp FASM or is there an x86 assembler out there designed to be used as a compiler backend. 
My Background : Not really a Programmer, but have learned a ltitle bit of Java back in the days in college. Have studied a little bit of Python through the book Automate the Boring Stuff (first half of the book) Have attempted to study some C++ a while back, but only gone through a few chapters. Overall, I'm not completely new to programming concepts, but at the same time I have never stuck long enough to really learn any language extensively or put them into a lot of practice. ampnbsp. Greetings! I'm having some issue here and I don't know how to tackle it. For several days now I'm trying to execute binary code directly in python now. I've tried the pycca library and pyasm2, and both have issues I can't get to resolve. Both of these produce machine code out of regular intel assembler syntax. pycca seriously lacks instructions and it's a huge waste of time implementing these. pyasm2 lacks an actual way of executing the code and trying to port that from pycca simply doesn't. I am writing a simple JIT for no serious purpose, which assembles a code, writes it to memory and then executes. The problem I stumbled upon is a console output. Currently I write all output to the last bytes of an allocated page and print them upon finishing executing. Though, this has some benefits (it's real quick, for example), it still is a hack. I tried to google for console outputs in assembler, but either I am really bad with googling or really unlucky but I couldn't find a solution. SOLVED Im programing with fasm assembler and windows api. I want to make a program that copies the content (music files specificly) of one directory and put them in another directory. Right now, I want to get information about the files in the directory. Right now I want to know how to get names of files that are in a specific directory. Is there a way to do it without any libraries other then the basic ones (win32ax). Hi, I was planning to do some real-world ASM this year by writing a small Unicode x64 Windows tool. Now, before I start with the wrong things in the first place, I wonder if NASM or FASM are a better starting point. I know that FASM is great for portable stuff, but what is your recommendation for a non-portable, easy and fast Windows assembler? :) Thanks. So believe it or not, I had dabbled as a young teenager in Assembly Language back in the 1980's on the 8088 microprocessor! I recall registers, and the "jmp" command, but that's about it! Since then, I've been really itching to get back into Assembly Language simply as a hobby, and because I really loved it so much, back in the 80's. (I'm also planning to now learn C++ at the same time.) Essentially, I want to try making some Artificial Intelligence programs, and perhaps even some retro-sty. I have been programming for 3 years as a hobby, I'm reasonably good at High level languages(specifically Java and C++) But I'd like a bash at Low Level Language and I am quite interested and ready for a challenge. I know there are many Assemblers such as FASM and MASM also a few more, I'd really like as much help on the different assemblers and a recommended architecture to work on and learn with. Thanks. I recently had the idea of learning old school openGL 1.1 and thought of writing it in assembler. I've been following NeHe's old tutorials and haven't come across it done in NASM only FASM. So far I am up to rotating a 3D cube. This is my first largish asm project so I am sure there are lots of optimisations I have missed. If anyone is interested here is a link to my git repo of the results so far. https://github.com/duncanspumpkin/NeHeNASM.
