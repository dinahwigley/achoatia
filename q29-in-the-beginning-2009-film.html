Hi there, /r/soccer. Tomorrow Ajax will play Willem II in the KNVB Cup final, which I found an ideal moment to talk about that time Ajax 2 almost played Ajax 1 in a cup final. ~~Also because I missed the 17 year anniversary of that match.~~ They ended up losing the semifinal to FC Utrecht only after penalties, who went on to lose the final against Ajax 1 after extra time.

This is a (very) long writeup I've been putting together for a while. It's about a case that took place fairly recently (2013) in my homecountry and, while at first sight looks quite cut-and-dry, its many intrincates have been a huge thing to deal with for LE and our justice system. A warning; the level of violence of this crime is extraordinary, which along with the young age of one of the two victims, may make this read too disturbing for some readers. Background amp#x. In the Beginning is a film directed by Xavier Giannoli and starring François Cluzet, Emmanuelle Devos, Stéphanie Sokolinski (AKA Soko). Background: This happened in 2008/2009, so about ten years ago now. I live in Germany and at that time, we were one of the only first-world nations to still have a mandatory draft (nine months of mandatory military service for every man, which you usually had to serve on completing high school).

After what seems like a lifetime of delays, cancellations, and reschedules, It Follows director David Robert Mitchell’s newest film, Under the Silver Lake finally lands on VOD and digital release this week. The film is the story of 33 year old perpetually inebriated slacker, Sam, as he scours the weird underbelly of Los Angeles in search of Sarah, the cute girl-next-door who has suddenly gone missing. The film is the latest to emerge in a genre I will aptly call “stonoire,” a subgenre of noire. Il film segue la comedie humaine di un criminale di mezza tacca, appena uscito di prigione, che riesce con espedienti truffaldini a rimettere - letteralmente - in cantiere un progetto autostradale abbandonato (causa scarafaggi…). I've been a horror aficionado for years now, and have finally gotten around to ranking the films in the "big" horror franchises. I qualify "big" as a franchise with name recognition that is known for its sequels, and has a relatively large following, so things like Basket Case won't be included. (Note, I haven't gotten around to seeing the Hellraiser films, and I see Alien amp Predator as Sci-Fi more than horror.) That said, here are my rankings: amp#x200B; Halloween Outside of Japan, hentai (変態 or へんたい; ￼listen (help·info) English: /ˈhɛntaɪ/; lit."pervert") is anime and manga pornography. In the Japanese language, however, "hentai" is not a genre of media but any type of perverse or bizarre sexual desire or act. For example, outside of Japan a work depicting lesbian sex might be described as "yuri hentai", but in Japan it would just be described as "yuri". The word is short for hentai seiyoku (変態性欲), a perverse sexual desire. The original meaning of hentai.
